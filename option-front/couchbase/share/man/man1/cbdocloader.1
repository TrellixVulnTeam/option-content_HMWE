.SH "NAME"
.PP
cbdocloader \- Loads sample datasets into Couchbase
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fIcbdocloader\fR [\-\-cluster <host>] [\-\-username <username>] [\-\-password <password>]
              [\-\-bucket <bucket>] [\-\-bucket\-quota <quota>] [\-\-dataset <path>]
              [\-\-thread <num>] [\-\-verbose]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
cbdocloader loads Couchbase sample datasets into Couchbase Server\&.
Sample data sets are zip files provided by Couchbase that contain documents and index definitions\&.
These datasets are meant for users to explore the various Couchbase features before loading in their own datasets\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Below are a list of required and optional parameters for the cbdocloader command\&.
.SS "Required"
.PP
\-c,\-\-cluster <host>
.RS 4
The hostname of one of the nodes in the cluster to load data into\&.
See the Host Formats section below for hostname specification details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u,\-\-username <username>
.RS 4
The username for cluster authentication\&.
The user must have the appropriate privileges to create a bucket, write data and create view, secondary index and full-text index definitions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p,\-\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for cluster authentication\&.
The user must have the appropriate privileges to create a bucket, write data and create view, secondary index and full-text index definitions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b,\-\-bucket
.RS 4
The name of the bucket to create and load data into\&.
If the bucket already exists then bucket creation is skipped and data is loaded into the existing bucket\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m,\-\-bucket-quota
.RS 4
The amount of memory to assign to the buckets cache\&.
If the bucket already exists then this parameter is ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d,\-\-dataset
.RS 4
The path to the sample dataset to load\&.
The path can either refer to a zip file or a directory to load data from\&.
.RE
.SS "Optional"
.PP
\-t,\-\-threads <num>
.RS 4
Specifies the number of concurrent clients to use when loading data\&.
Fewer clients means data loading will take longer, but there will be less cluster resources used\&.
More clients means faster data loading, but at the cost of more cluster resource usage\&.
This parameter defaults to 1 if it is not specified and it is recommended that this parameter is not set to be higher than the number of CPUs on the machine where the command is being run\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v,\-\-verbose
.RS 4
Prints log messages to stdout\&.
This flag is useful for debugging errors in the data loading process\&.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.PP
When specifying a host for the \fIcbdoclader\fR command the following formats are expected:
.IP \(bu 4
couchbase://<addr>
.IP \(bu 4
<addr>:<port>
.IP \(bu 4
http://<addr>:<port>
.PP
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard installations\&.
The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To load the dataset travel-sample.zip which is located at /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip into a bucket with a memory quota of 1024MB we would run the following command.
.sp
.DS 4
   $ cbdocloader -c couchbase://127.0.0.1 -u Administrator -p password -m 1024 \\
     -b travel-sample -d /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip
.DE
.PP
If we want to increase the parallelism of data loading then we can increase the parallelism by using the threads option\&.
In the example below we will use 4 threads\&.
.sp
.DS 4
   $ cbdocloader -c couchbase://127.0.0.1 -u Administrator -p password -m 1024 \\
     -b travel-sample -d /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip -t 4
.DE
.PP
The cbdocloader command can also be used to load data from a folder\&.
This folder must contain files that correspond to the samples format\&.
See the SAMPLE DATA FORMAT section below for more information on this format\&.
Below is an example of how to load data from a folder /home/alice/census-sample
.sp
.DS 4
   $ cbdocloader -c couchbase://127.0.0.1 -u Administrator -p password -m 1024 \\
     -b census-sample -d /home/alice/census-sample
.DE
.SH "SAMPLE DATA FORMAT"
.PP
The cbdocloader command is used to load data from zip files or folders that correspond to the Couchbase sample data format\&.
An example of this format is below.
.sp
.DS 4
    + sample_folder
      + design_docs
        indexes.json
        design_doc.json
      + docs
        document1.json
        document2.json
        document3.json
        document4.json
.DE
.PP
The top level directory can be given any name and will always contain two folders\&.
The "design_docs" folder is where index definitions are kept\&.
This folder will contain zero or more json files that contain the various indexes that should be created when the sample dataset is loaded\&.
Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) should always be in a file named "indexes.json"\&.
Below is an example of the format for defining GSI indexes.
.sp
.DS 4
    {
      "statements": [
        {
          "statement": "CREATE PRIMARY INDEX on `bucket1`",
          "args": null
        },
        {
          "statement": "CREATE INDEX by_type on `bucket1`(name) WHERE _type='User'" 
          "args": null
        }
      ]
    }
.PP
GSI indexes are defined as a JSON document where each index definition is contained in a list called "statements"\&.
Each element in the list is an object that contains two keys\&.
The "statement" key contains that actual index definition and the "args" key is used if the statement contains any positional arguments\&.
.PP
All other files in the design_docs folder are used to define view design documents and each design document should be put into a separate file\&.
These files can be named anything, but should always have the ".json" file extension\&.
Below is an example of a view design document definition\&.
.sp
.DS 4
    {
      "_id": "_design/players"
      "views": {
        "total_experience": {
          "map": "function(doc,meta){if(doc.jsonType == \"player\" && doc.experience){emit(doc.experience, null);}}"
          "reduce": "_sum"
        },
        "player_list": {
          "map": "function (doc, meta){if(doc.jsonType == \"player\") {emit(meta.id, null);}}"
        }
      }
    }
.DE
.PP
In the document above, the "_id" field is used to name the design document\&.
This name should always be prefixed with "_design/"\&.
The other field in the top level of the document is the "views" field\&.
This field contains a map of view definitions\&.
The key for each element in the map is the name of the view\&.
Each view must contain a "map" element that defines the map function and may also contain an optional "reduce" element that defines the reduce function\&.
.PP
View design documents support map-reduce views as well as spatial views\&.
Below is an example of a spatial view definition\&.
Spatial views follow similar rules as the map-reduce views above\&.

.sp
.DS 4
    {
      "_id": "_design/spatial"
      "spatial": {
	"position": "<spatial view function definition>",
	"location": "<spatial view function definition>"
      }
    }
.DE
.PP
Note that spatial views only use a single function to define the index\&.
As a result this function is defined as the value of the spatial views name\&.
.PP
The other folder at the top level directory of a sample data folder is the "docs" folder\*.
This folder will contain all of the documents to load into Couchbase\&.
Each document in this folder is contained in a separate file and each file should contain a single JSON document\&.
The key name for the document will be the name of the file\&.
Each file should also have a ".json" file extension which will be removed from the key name when the data is loaded\&.
Since each document to be loaded into Couchbase is in a separate file there can potentially be a large amount of files\&.
The docs folder allows subfolders to help categorize documents\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"

CB_USERNAME - The username of the Couchbase cluster to connect to\&.
CB_PASSWORD - The password of the Couchbase cluster to connect to\&.
