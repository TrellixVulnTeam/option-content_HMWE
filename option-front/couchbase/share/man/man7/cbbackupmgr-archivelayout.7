cbbackupmgr\-archivelayout \- The backup archive layout specification
.SH "SPECIFICATION"
.sp
The backup archive is used to store all backup data and the layout format is
detailed below. The top level directory of the archive is called the archive
backup. The backup archive will contain one or more backup repositories and a
logs directory. The logs directory will contain logging information for all
cbbackupmgr commands run on the backup archive. Each backup repository will
contain backups for a specific cluster and each backup is done on a cluster
incrementally. All backups in a backup repository will be names with a timestamp
that corresponds to the time it was taken. Since backups are taken incrementally
this timestamp will always be increasing. When a backup is taken it will use the
backup configuration (backup\-meta.json) in the specified backup repository to
retrieve information for how the backup should be taken. If multiple buckets are
specified to be backed up then there wil be separate bucket backup folders
created for each bucket that is backed up.

backup\-meta.json
.RS 4
This file is used to store the backup configuration for a backup repository.
Each time a backup is run it will read these options, connect to the
cluster, and backup data from the point where it last left off. All
parameters in this file are specified when creating the backup repository.
The backup configuration file will contain data that looks something like
the example below.

These are forestdb files that contain the cluster data. The amount of shards
will depend on the amount of clients used during the backup. The amount of
client is is specified with the \-\-threads flag in the
\fBcbbackupmgr\-backup\fP(1) command.
