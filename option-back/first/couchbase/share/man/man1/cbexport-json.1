.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Exports JSON data from Couchbase. The cbexport\-json command supports exporting
JSON docments to a file with a document on each line or a file that contain a
JSON list where each element is a document. The file format to export to can be
specified with the \-\-format flag. See the DATASET FORMATS section below for more
details on the supported file formats.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Below are a list of required and optional parameters for the cbexport\-json
command.
.SS "Required"
.sp
\-c,\-\-cluster <url>
.RS 4
The hostname of a node in the cluster to export data from. See the HOST
FORMATS section below for details about hostname specification formats.
.RE
.sp
\-u,\-\-username <username>
.RS 4
The username for cluster authentication. The user must have the appropriate
privileges to read the bucket in which data will be exported from.
.RE
.sp
\-p,\-\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for cluster authentication. The user must have the appropriate
privileges to read from the bucket in which data will be exported from.
Specifying this option without a value will allow the user to type a
non\-echoed password to stdin.
.RE
.sp
\-b,\-\-bucket <bucket_name>
.RS 4
The name of the bucket to export data from.
.RE
.sp
\-f,\-\-format <format>
.RS 4
The format of the dataset specified (lines or list). See the DATASET FORMATS
section below for more details on the formats supported by cbexport.
.RE
.sp
\-o,\-\-output <path>
.RS 4
The path to the location of the file that JSON documnets from Couchbase
should be exported to. This may be an absolute or relative path, but must
point to a file. The file does not have to exist when the command is
invoked.
.RE
.SS "Optional"
.sp
\-\-include\-key <key>
.RS 4
Couchbase stores data as key value pairs where the value is a JSON document
and the key is an identifier for retrieving that document. By default
cbexport will only export the value portion of the document. If you wish to
include the key in the exported document then this option should be
specified. The value passed to this option should be the field name that the
key is stored under. If the value passed already exists as a field in the
document, it will be overridden with the key. If the JSON document is not an
object it will be turn into one and the value added to a field named \(aqvalue\(aq.
If the key value passed is \(aqvalue\(aq then the key will not be written. It will
display a warning for any document it has converted into an object.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-ssl\-verify
.RS 4
Skips the SSL verification phase. Specifying this flag will allow a
connection using SSL encryption, but will not verify the identity of the
server you connect to. You are vulnerable to a man\-in\-the\-middle attack if
you use this flag. Either this flag or the \-\-cacert flag must be specified
when using an SSL encrypted connection.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cacert <cert_path>
.RS 4
Specifies a CA certificate that will be used to verify the identity of the
server being connecting to. Either this flag or the \-\-no\-ssl\-verify flag
must be specified when using an SSL encrypted connection.
.RE
.sp
\-t,\-\-threads <num>
.RS 4
Specifies the number of concurrent clients to use when exporting data. Fewer
clients means exports will take longer, but there will be less cluster
resources used to complete the export. More clients means faster exports,
but at the cost of more cluster resource usage. This parameter defaults to 1
if it is not specified and it is recommended that this parameter is not set
to be higher than the number of CPUs on the machine where the export is
taking place.
.RE
.sp
\-l,\-\-log\-file <path>
.RS 4
Specifies a log file for writing debugging information about cbexport
execution.
.RE
.sp
\-v,\-\-verbose
.RS 4
Specifies that logging should be sent to stdout. If this flag is specified
along with the \-l/\-\-log\-file option then the verbose option is ignored.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "DATASET FORMATS"
.sp
The cbexport command supports the formats listed below.
.SS "LINES"
.sp
The lines format specifies a file that contains one JSON document on every line
in the file. This format is specified by setting the \-\-format option to "lines".
Below is an example of a file in lines format.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
{"key": "mykey1", "value": "myvalue1"}
{"key": "mykey2", "value": "myvalue2"}
{"key": "mykey3", "value": "myvalue3"}
{"key": "mykey4", "value": "myvalue4"}
.fi
.if n .RE
.SS "LIST"
.sp
The list format specifies a file which contains a JSON list where each element
in the list is a JSON document. The file may only contain a single list, but the
list may be specified over multiple lines. This format is specified by setting
the \-\-format option to "list". Below is an example of a file in list format.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
[
  {
    "key": "mykey1",
    "value": "myvalue1"
  },
  {"key": "mykey2", "value": "myvalue2"},
  {"key": "mykey3", "value": "myvalue3"},
  {"key": "mykey4", "value": "myvalue4"}
]
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To export data to /data/lines.json using the lines format and running with 4
threads the following command can be run.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ cbexport json \-c couchbase://127.0.0.1 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
 \-b default \-o /data/lines.json \-f lines \-t 4
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To export data from /data/list.json using the list format the following command
can be run.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
