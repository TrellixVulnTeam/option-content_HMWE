.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The merge command is used in order to merge two or more backups together. Since
cbbackupmgr is a utility that always takes incremental backups it is necessary
to reclaim disk space from time to time. Merging data will de\-duplicate similar
keys in backup files being merged together in order to create a single smaller
backup file. Doing merges should replace the full backup step by taking multiple
incremental backups of a Couchbase cluster and converting them into a single
full backup. Since this process takes place in the backup archive there is no
cluster overhead to merging data together. See
\fBcbbackupmgr\-strategies\fP(7) for suggestions on using the merge command
in your backup process.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Below are a list of required parameters for the merge command.
.SS "Required"
.sp
\-a,\-\-archive <archive_dir>
.RS 4
The archive directory to merge data in.
.RE
.sp
\-r,\-\-repo <repo_name>
.RS 4
The name of the backup repository to merge data in.
.RE
.SS "Optional"
.sp
\-\-start <backup>
.RS 4
The name of the first backup to be merged or an index value which references
an incremental backup. Valid index values are any positive integer,
"oldest", and "latest". If a positive integer is used then it should
reference the index of the incremental backup starting from the oldest to
the most recent backup. For example, "1" corresponds to the oldest backup,
"2" corresponds to the second oldest backup, and so on. Specifying "oldest"
means that the index of the oldest backup should be used and specifying
"latest" means the index of the most recent backup should be used.
.RE
.sp
\-\-end <backup>
.RS 4
The name of the last backup to be merged or a index value which references
an incremental backup. Valid index values are any positive integer,
"oldest", and "latest". If a positive integer is used then it should
reference the index of the incremental backup starting from the oldest to
the most recent backup. For example, "1" corresponds to the oldest backup,
"2" corresponds to the second oldest backup, and so on. Specifying "oldest"
means that the index of the oldest backup should be used and specifying
"latest" means the index of the most recent backup should be used.
.RE
.sp
\-\-date\-range <range>
.RS 4
This flag takes a comma separated range of
start backup day to merge and end backup to merge (inclusive).
The accepted formats are dd\-mm\-yy, backup directory name or backup
index, with the first backup being number 0. To read more about format
go to the section BACKUP RANGES.
.RE
.sp
\-t,\-\-threads <num>
.RS 4
Specifies the number of concurrent vBuckets that will be merged at a time.
Increasing the threads will make the merge faster but will also increase the
resource used by the client. This parameter defaults to 1 but it is
recommended to increase it to match the number of CPUs in the client machine.
.RE
.SH "BACKUP RANGES"
.sp
The merge command accepts a pair of dates, indices or backup directory names using
the \f(CR\-\-backups\fP argument  which can be used to refine which backups in the
repository to merge.
.sp
When given the backup range \(aq0,5\(aq merge will merge all of the backups in chronological
order starting from the first backup, finishing with the fifth backup.
.sp
When given the backup range \(aq20\-08\-2019,23\-08\-2019\(aq merge will merge all the backups
which fall within these two dates (inclusive). Note that the format must be \(aqday\-month\-year\(aq
this means that \(aq01\-30\-19\(aq is an invalid date and will be rejected by merge.
.sp
Merge also accepts a backup range using the names of backups e.g. \(aq2019\-08\-23T09_36_56.957232625Z\(aq.
Therefore, given the backup range \(aq2019\-08\-20T11_39_34.232308323Z,2019\-08\-23T09_36_56.957232625Z\(aq
merge will merge all backups which fall within these two backups.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
In order to merge data, you need to have a backup repository with at least two
backups. Below is an example of merging a backup repository named "example" that
has two backups in it. The first backup contains the initial dataset. The second
backup was taken after four items were updated.

Upon completion of the merge the number of items in the backup files is the
same. This is because the keys in the second backup were also contained in the
first backup, but the keys in the second backup contained newer values and
overwrote the keys in the first backup during the merge. The timestamp of the
backup folder is also the same as the timestamp of the latest backup because the
new backup is a snapshot of the cluster at that point in time.
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
It is important that internally the merge command is able to merge backups
together without corrupting the backup archive or leaving it in an intermediate
state. In order to ensure this behavior cbbackupmgr always creates a new backup
and completely merges all data before removing any backup files. When a merge is
started a .merge_status file is created in the backup repository to track the
merge progress. cbbackupmgr then copies the first backup to the .merge folder
and begins merging the other backups into .merge folder. After each backup is
merged the .merge_status file is updated to track the merge progress. if all
backups are merged together successfully, cbbackupmgr will start deleting the
old backups and then copy the fully merged backup into a folder containing the
same name as the backup specified by the \-\-end flag. If the cbbackupmgr utility
fails during this process, then the merge will either be completed or the
partial merge files will be removed from the backup repository during the next
invocation of the cbbackupmgr.
.sp
Since the merge command creates a new backup file before it removes the old ones
it is necessary to have at least as much free space as the backups that are to
be merge together.
